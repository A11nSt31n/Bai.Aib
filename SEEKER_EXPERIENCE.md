# Seeker Experience & Privacy Protections | Bai Aib

This document outlines how users (referred to as *seekers*) interact with the Bai Aib platform — and how their anonymity, dignity, and healing journey are safeguarded at every step.

## The Seeker’s Journey

Bai Aib is for anyone struggling with sin, regret, addiction, or spiritual fatigue — who is ready to make a change, but needs **safe, anonymous, and consistent support**.

## What to Expect

| Step                              | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Anonymous Signup**              | No names, IC, or personal details required — just anonymized login key and password, email address only for user functions like forgot password, session reminders |
| **Choose a Du’a Name**            | Start your journey with a beautiful pseudonym (e.g. *Nur*, *Shifa*, *Rayyan*) that reflects your goals |
| **Book Private Sessions**         | Get paired with a local Asatizah trained in spiritual care, for 1:1 support |
| **Optional Journaling**           | Privately reflect in your own space — you control what gets shared (if anything) |
| **Join Group Circles (Optional)** | Anonymous, moderated support circles (gender-specific) for shared strength and du’a |
| **Use Voice Modulation or Avatar**| Full privacy, even in group settings |
| **Follow Up**                     | Continue building spiritual momentum with consistent check-ins and reminders |

## Your Privacy, Always Protected

- You never need to reveal your real name, background, or detail into your past sins
- Only your assigned Asatizah sees your “du’a name” and notes — no other user, moderators unparticipative mainly there for safety in case matters escalate
- Your journaling is visible **only to you**, option to share screen with Asatizah to facilitate sessions but only if you grant permission
- You choose whether to join circles, and whether to speak or listen only

## Islamic Principles Honored

This platform follows these guiding values:
- *Satr*: your faults are veiled, and no one is encouraged to reveal sin
- *Taubah*: every step is an act of returning to Allah — not perfection, but sincerity
- *Tawakkul*: we trust in Divine Mercy, while taking the means of healing

## You're Not Alone

Whether you’re here for one session or a long journey, you are seen, valued, and supported. Bai Aib exists to **help you reconnect — not only with Allah, but with hope.**
