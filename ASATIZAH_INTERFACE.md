# Asatizah Interface & Ethical Safeguards | Bai Aib

This document outlines the purpose, design, and ethical considerations behind the moderator interface designed **exclusively for Asatizah** who provide spiritual guidance through the Bai Aib platform.

---

## Purpose

The Asatizah (Mod) Interface exists to **enhance the continuity of care** for seekers of taubah and healing — without compromising their privacy or the Islamic principles of *satr* (concealing faults) and *adab* (respectful boundaries).

## Key Features

| Feature                             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Session History Viewer**          | View anonymized logs of past sessions with assigned seekers (no real names) |
| **Follow-up Scheduler**             | Book future sessions with the same user to ensure consistency               |
| **Note-Taking Panel**               | Write private reflections or reminders visible only to the Asatizah         |
| **Ethical Concern Flagging**        | Discreetly escalate serious cases (e.g. risk of harm, self-endangerment)    |
| **Progress Tracker (Optional)**     | Track overall engagement patterns (e.g. attendance, journaling frequency)   |
| **Du’a Suggestion Library**         | Recommend spiritual du’as or Qur’anic verses tailored to the user’s journey |

---

## Ethical Boundaries

- No identifiable data of users is revealed — only their **du’a-based pseudonym**
- No diagnosis, only **spiritual support and general advice**
- Logs are encrypted and visible **only to the assigned Asatizah**
- Group support moderators may only see general attendance, not individual content

---

## Why These Safeguards Matter

- Asatizahs are part of the community too — these boundaries **protect them from knowing more than necessary**, especially in a small society like Singapore.
- The interface prevents overreliance on memory or offline logs, while ensuring **care remains intentional and repeatable**.
- It upholds the prophetic value of *haya’* (modesty), where no one is forced to expose their past but is gently guided toward redemption.

## Built with the Ummah’s Trust in Mind

The Asatizah interface will always be **opt-in**, and designed in consultation with religious teachers and mental health professionals. This is not just a feature — it’s a commitment to the spiritual and emotional safety of both seekers and guides.
