# Bai Aib | بَيْ عَيْب

**Tagline:** Goodbye shame, hello hope. A tech-enabled bridge between repentance, community, and compassionate Islamic support.

---

## Overview

**Bai Aib** is a conceptual platform designed for Muslims seeking consistent, anonymous support on their journey of repentance (*taubah*), healing, and positive change. This project was inspired by real community gaps voiced by teachers and mentors who saw the limitations of one-off advice platforms.

## Key Features

- **Anonymous Pseudo-Islamic Names**: Each user adopts a beautiful name (e.g. *Nur*, *Amal*, *Ihsan*) to protect their identity and symbolize their hijrah.
- **End-to-End Confidentiality**: Sessions use avatars or voice modulation for added privacy.
- **Faith-Based Support Circles**: Optional group support modeled after AA principles, moderated by trained Asatizahs.
- **Journaling & Reflection Tools**: Prompts, du’as, and relapse logs to support the seeker between sessions.
- **Session Tracker**: Schedule 1:1 or follow-up spiritual coaching across weeks/months.

## Why "Bai Aib"?

In Malay-Arabic, "Bai" (bye) meets "Aib" (shame, fault). The name reflects our intention: to **gently say goodbye to shame** — not by broadcasting sins, but by walking quietly, consistently, and supported on the path of taubah.

---

## Ethics-Centered Development

All features are built with the Islamic principles of:
- *Satr*: covering a fellow Muslim’s faults
- *Adab*: respecting boundaries and trust
- *Ihsan*: striving to do right even when no one sees
